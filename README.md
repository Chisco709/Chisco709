 # Hi, I'm Juanjo 👋

I'm a software programming student from Colombia.
I enjoy learning step by step, and right now I'm exploring:

* 🐍 Python (a little FastAPI)
* 🗄️ SQL basics
* ⚙️ Backend fundamentals

I also love  books, and improving my memory skills.
Here I share small projects as I keep growing.
